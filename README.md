# House-of-the-CyberDead-main
HOW TO PLAY:
Use WASD to move, toggle your light with L, shoot with left mouse button (when you get the gun), and pickup and use the keycard with E.
There are two guards (currently represented by red cylinders for the prototype), they will patrol and chase the player if they see you, there are rooms you can duck into to try and lose the guards.

Spawn room is brightly lit for the purpose of functioning as the art prototype room, rest of the level is the gameplay prototype. Level will be extremely dark on final release, current lighting is for ease of design and testing.

IMPORTANT INFO:
Make sure to turn your computer volume down, the gunshot SFX is very loud and the in-game volume slider isn't affecting it yet.
Guard doesn't die yet when you shoot him, you can just press E on him to grab the keycard.
Win condition isn't fully implemented yet, when you get into the elevator in the final game you'll get a win screen but for now nothing happens in there.
